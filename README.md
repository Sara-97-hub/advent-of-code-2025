# Advent of Code 2025 – Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2025 challenges written in Python.

I used these daily programming puzzles as a self-study project to learn Python from scratch and practice problem solving on real tasks.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to learn Python by actively solving problems instead of only reading documentation or tutorials.

Through this project I focused on:

* understanding problem statements
* turning ideas into algorithms
* debugging syntax and logic errors
* gradually improving code readability

## What I Learned

While solving these challenges I gained practical experience with:

* loops and conditional statements
* string parsing and manipulation
* reading and processing input files
* tracking state using variables
* handling edge cases
* fixing indentation and runtime errors in Python

## Project Structure

Each day is implemented as a separate Python script:

day01.py
day02.py
day03.py
...

Each script reads its own input file and prints the final solution to the console.

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Run any task from the terminal:

python day01.py

## Why This Project

I chose Advent of Code as a structured way to teach myself Python while also developing algorithmic thinking and debugging skills.

## Technologies

* Python 3
